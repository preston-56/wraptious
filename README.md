**Problem Statement: Random Selection Utility**

**Overview**

- You have been tasked with developing a utility function that facilitates the random selection of items from a specified numeric range. This function is essential for various applications, including selecting judges for art competitions or any scenario where randomized selection from a predefined range is required.
  
- For detailed guidelines and specifications regarding the implementation of the utility function, please refer to the comprehensive document provided in the accompanying [PDF](./final.pdf). 
  
- It includes thorough explanations, examples, and use cases to help you effectively utilize and understand the utility function within your applications.

**Implementation Notes**

Utilize JavaScript to implement the function and ensure it adheres to the specified requirements.

Write comprehensive [JEST](https://jestjs.io/) tests to validate the function's behavior across different scenarios, including edge cases and typical use cases.

**Running Tests**
- Before running the test file, you should ensure that you have installed JEST. To achieve this, run the following command:
```
npm install jest
```
After the installation, run the tests.

```
npm run test
```

NB: The second test is deliberately designed to fail.
